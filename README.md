Demo not working? Due to the free Heroku hosting package, the url above works only for ~18 hours a day, so check back later! or... install on your local machine.

## üìñ Installation  

Clone this repository and open your terminal in the project folder and install dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```
Also make sure to install the database dependencies as we have a little back-end server for the REST API.
```bash
cd db
npm install
```
Go back to parent directory and run the app with  **npm run app**    

```bash
cd ../
npm run app
```
The app will be located at **http://localhost:1234/**   
The database is located at **http://localhost:3000/api/**  
Api endpoints: **/users/** and **/groups/**
